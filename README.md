## Part 1: Drawing the map

The land in this map has no fill. Change the color of the states.
What happens if you change the color of the land border? What about the .state-boundaries border?
Change the width of the borders.
Adjust the zoom of the map.
Have the map show counties instead of states.

## Part 2: Changing out the Data

Last week, we created a .csv with airport origins, destinations, and counts.
Replace the flights-airport_all.csv with this csv in the code.

Advanced:
Change the radius of the circle to depend upon number of flights (counts) instead of "links".
